# Contributing to Greppo

Wooohooo, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada:

The project is hosted in the [Greppo organisation](https://github.com/greppo-io/) on GitHub. 

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing. These are not rules, but mere guidelines. So, please feel free to propose changes to any part of the organisation and the material within.

## How do you start?

For getting the development environment setup, please read the DEVDOC.md in the root of this repository. The project consists of two parts, the frontend components, and the backend components which includes the Python package.

## What do you start with?

Before proposing new features, please add an issue and discuss it with the community before a PR. If you don't know where to start with, take a look at the roadmap/milestone to track what is planned. And, if you feel comfortable in contributing to one of them, pick up the respective issue and comment your proposal on how to solve it. 

## Yes, it doesn't have all the bells and whistles of a complete project.

What started of as a solution for a personal project, has turned out to be a Python package. It is a contribution back to the community. So, please feel to add in those bells and whistles you feel would make this project grow!
